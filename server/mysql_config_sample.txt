//
//	This file defines MySQL configuration data.
//	This is a sample of the file used for MySQL configurations. The default file used by servers is named default_mysql_config.txt.
//	Copy this file and rename it to that to use the default settings.
//
//	To use another configuration file, set the as_mysql_config cvar to the path and name of the file, including the extension.
//	E.g. The default file is set to server/default_mysql_config.txt
//

//	This defines the default configuration for MySQL connections made by scripts.
//	This is only an example and will not work on any servers that have been properly configured.
//	If it does work, please configure your MySQL server correctly.
